US Army Ft Irwin Pesticide Use Reporting App created by MDEP

Every military installation must report monthly on it's use of pesticide products. 

The Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program designed and wrote this mobile friendly web app to allow users to input pertinent information regarding the use of various pesticides and then digitally recreate a completed DOD Form XXXX for the monthly reporting. This initiative set about to make the entire process more streamlined and increase productivity.

Previously, the report was an excel spreadsheet filled out manually.

Written in HTML using forms, PHP, Javascript and PHPtoExcel. Database is MySQL.
